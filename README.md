## Assignment Details

- For all assignments, your submission should contain a report. The report should contain screenshots or outputs of the results, and the running time, at the very least. If you work in a Jupyter (or Colab, etc.) notebook, you do not need to submit a separate report file, but you should include the results and descriptions in the notebook itself; otherwise, your submission should contain a PDF report.
- Make sure you read the assignment description carefully to include all the requested material and results.
- If you, for any reason, decide to change your groups, please send an email to me at <fschm@kth.se> and indicate your previous group number and the new one. You do not have to provide any explanation for the change.
- Reserving timeslots for homework presentations is only possible if you are a member of a "Homework Group", so if you cannot book a timeslot, make sure you are in a "Homework" group. Even if you are doing the assignments individually, you should subscribe to a "Homework" group.
- When submitting deliverables for assignments that require a dataset as input, e.g., Homework 2,  please make sure not to include the dataset in the zip file, as it will lead to an unnecessarily large zip file. For assignments that you can choose your own dataset, instead of putting the dataset in the zip file, include an accessible download link in your report.
